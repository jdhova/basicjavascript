# Basic JavaScript Algorithms

Hi there this is the assignment for the iron hackers hope you like it!

## As a Text Marketeer I want to be able to find all the Palindromes in a certain text

### Given

I have the following text:

A guy was driving in a Honda civic minding his own business. When suddenly Anna ran over the street. Because her dog wanted to poop at a spot what was not allowed. Luckly the pokemon girafarig was there to stop the car. On that same moment a Pokemon trainer evolved Eevee to Jolteon. What an exciting day! I have to tell this complete story to my mom. When I went home to tell the story. I relaxed at the irori where I drunk some tee. Finally at noon I was able to tell my family. What was awesome they all had a crazy day them self. We all talked our day over at the irori. Where me and my family now hope you found all the palindromes and hope that you will join our family 2

### When

I run the code

### Then

I want as out put all the palindromes and the first letter in Capital



########  Speed Limit Catcher

Check speed Limit of a Driver,
If the minimum speed limit of a Driver is 70km/hr write a function that takes in 2 arguments, 

# When 

I run the code

If the Driver drives between 70 and 74km he should get the OK message

For every 5km above 70km/hr the driver should get 1 point and 

If he gets 12 points his licece should be suspended. 

### write a function with one arg takes a number and write even of odd numbers
